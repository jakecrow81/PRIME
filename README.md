# PRIME bot
## PRIME is a custom discord bot made for the Echelon Foundation (https://echelon.io). PRIME aggregates data related to the Prime ERC-20 token on Ethereum, stores it in multiple databases and quickly retrieves this data for users on demand.

These databases contain information on caching emissions, circulating supply, investor unlocks, Prime sinks and more. When a Discord user inputs a command the bot will pull data from the appropriate database and quickly output that data to the user in a helpful format. The databases are automatically updated every 15 minutes to ensure data is up to date.
